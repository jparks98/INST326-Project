# INST326-Project
This program looks to answer the question of "What affects movies from the 2000s gross earning?" How it accomplishes that task is by running through a CSV file with several movies from the '60s to the 2000s. it then selects movies from 2000 and beyond only and run a multitude of tests and statistical analysis to see if there is an effect on the earnings.
