# INST326-Project

Here, you will find three python scripts that all work to analyze the movie data set that was procured from this link: 
(http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i247s13/files/2013/01/Box-Office-Dataset-1.xls (Links to an external site.) 

Two files deal with the linear regression and t-tests, respectively and the last python script contains the graphs and descriptive
statistics of the project. Most of the code is done in small chunks and is regularly commented upon to provide explanations for 
the thought processes behind each code. 

These files all work independently and showcase the complexities when looking at a movie's gross income with regards to genre and
rating.
